# âš¡ Discrete Choice Modeling of Electricity Suppliers with Generalized Multinomial Logit (GMNL)
# Author: Viriya Gunawan Lim
#
# ðŸ“Œ Project Description
# This project estimates a Generalized Multinomial Logit (GMNL) or Mixed Logit with Integrated Lognormal Scale (MIXL-ILS)
# model using the Electricity dataset from the mlogit package, implemented
# through the gmnl package.
#
# The dataset is panel data, with:
# - 361 individuals
# - 4,308 observations
# - Each individual faced 12 hypothetical choice scenarios
#
# In each scenario, consumers chose between 4 electricity suppliers described by:
# - Price scheme: fixed (pf), time-of-day (tod), or seasonal (seas)
# - Contract length (cl)
# - Local supplier (loc)
# - Well-known supplier (wk)
#
# Since the design considered unlabeled alternatives,
# alternative-specific constants (ASCs) are set to zero.
#
# ðŸ›  Steps
# 1. Load and preprocess data:
#    - Convert from wide to long format for estimation
#    - Use a subsample (1:3000) to reduce computation time
# 2. Estimate baseline Multinomial Logit (MNL)
#    - Includes cl, loc, wk, tod, seas
# 3. Perform Hausmanâ€“McFadden Test
#    - Checks the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption
# 4. Estimate GMNL (MIXL-ILS) with gmnl
#    - Random coefficients for cl, loc, wk, tod, seas
#    - Allows heterogeneity in consumer preferences and scale
#    - Estimates covariance and correlation between random coefficients
#
# âœ… Insights
# - MNL provides a baseline, but IIA is restrictive
# - MIXL-ILS captures taste heterogeneity and realistic substitution patterns
# - Panel data improves modeling of repeated choices by the same individuals
